### Next (Roadmap)
- capture messages for all kinds of formatted validate and plan non-syntax errors (note that this may inadvertently start capturing syntax errors elsewhere in the directory but probably will not due to the way I wrote the regexps)
- travisci
- jasmine+babel

### 1.1.0
- Added severity key.
- Show syntax errors for only active file and not all files in active directory.
- Add `terraform plan` option.

### 1.0.0
- Initial version ready for wide usage.
