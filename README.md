### Linter-Terraform-Syntax
`Linter-Terraform-Syntax` aims to provide functional and robust `terraform validate` linting functionality within Atom.

### Installation
`Terraform` is required to be installed before using this. The `Linter` and `Language-Terraform` atom packages are also required but should be automatically installed as dependencies thanks to steelbrain's `package-deps`.

### Usage
- This linter and `terraform validate` are both simple and straightforward, and therefore this has no special usage instructions.
